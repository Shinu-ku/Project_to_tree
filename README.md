## Project to Tree

This tool generates a tree-style directory diagram from an existing project folder.

It is useful for:
- Documenting project structure
- Sharing architecture in README files
- Copying the tree into ChatGPT or documentation
- Recreating the structure later using `tree_to_project.py`

---

### Usage

Run the script from the root of your project:

```bash
python project_to_tree.py
